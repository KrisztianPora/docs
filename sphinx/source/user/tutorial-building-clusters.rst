Tutorials on building clusters
==============================

Docker-Swarm cluster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This tutorial sets up a complete Docker infrastructure with Swarm, Docker and Consul software components. It contains a master node and predefined number of worker nodes. The worker nodes receive the ip of the master node and attach to the master node to form a cluster. Finally, the docker cluster can be used with any standard tool talking the docker protocol (on port 2375).

**Features**

 - creating two types of nodes through contextualisation
 - passing ip address of a node to another node
 - using the occi resource handler
 - utilising health check against a predefined port
 - using parameters to scale up worker nodes

**Prerequisites**

 - accessing an Occopus compatible interface 
 - target cloud contains an Ubuntu 14.04 image with cloud-init support

**Download**

You can download the example as `tutorial.examples.docker-swarm <../../examples/docker-swarm.tgz>`_ .

**Steps**

The following steps are suggested to be performed:

#. Open the file ``nodes/node_definitions.yaml`` and edit the resource section of the nodes labelled by ``node_def:``.

   - you must select an `Occopus compatible resource plugin <clouds.html>`_ 
   - you can find and specify the relevant `list of attributes for the plugin <createinfra.html#resource>`_
   - you may follow the help on `collecting the values of the attributes for the plugin <createinfra.html#collecting-resource-attributes>`_
   - you may find a resource template for the plugin in the `resource plugin tutorials <tutorial-resource-plugins.html>`_

   The downloadable package for this example contains a resource template for the Cloudsigma plugin.

#. Components in the infrastructure connect to each other, therefore several port ranges must be opened for the VMs executing the components. Clouds implement port opening various way (e.g. security groups for OpenStack, etc). Make sure you implement port opening in your cloud for the following port ranges:

   .. code::

      TCP 2375 
      TCP 2377
      TCP 7946

   .. note:: 
       Do not forget to open the ports which are needed for your Docker application!

#. Make sure your authentication information is set correctly in your authentication file. You must set your email and password in the authentication file. Setting authentication information is described :ref:`here <authentication>`.

#. Load the node definition for ``dockerswarm_master_node`` and ``dockerswarm_worker_node`` nodes into the database.

   .. important::

      Occopus takes node definitions from its database when builds up the infrastructure, so importing is necessary whenever the node definition (file) changes!

   .. code::

      occopus-import nodes/node_definitions.yaml

#. Update the number of worker nodes if necessary. For this, edit the ``infra-docker-swarm.yaml`` file and modify the ``min`` parameter under the ``scaling`` keyword. Currently, it is set to ``2``.

   .. code::

     - &W
         name: worker
         type: dockerswarm_worker_node
         scaling:
             min: 2

#. Start deploying the infrastructure. Make sure the proper virtualenv is activated!

   .. code::

      occopus-build infra-docker-swarm.yaml

   .. note::

      It may take a few minutes until the services on the master node come to live. Please, be patient!

#. After successful finish, the node with ``ip address`` and ``node id`` are listed at the end of the logging messages and the identifier of the newly built infrastructure is printed. You can store the identifier of the infrastructure to perform further operations on your infra or alternatively you can query the identifier using the **occopus-maintain** command.

   .. code::

     List of nodes/ip addresses:
     master:
       <ip-address> (dfa5f4f5-7d69-432e-87f9-a37cd6376f7a)
     worker:
       <ip-address> (cae40ed8-c4f3-49cd-bc73-92a8c027ff2c)
       <ip-address> (8e255594-5d9a-4106-920c-62591aabd899)
     77cb026b-2f81-46a5-87c5-2adf13e1b2d3

#. Check the result by submitting docker commands to the docker master node!

#. Finally, you may destroy the infrastructure using the infrastructure id returned by ``occopus-build``

   .. code::

      occopus-destroy -i 77cb026b-2f81-46a5-87c5-2adf13e1b2d3

Hadoop cluster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This tutorial sets up a complete Apache Hadoop infrastructure. It contains a Hadoop Master node and Hadoop Slave worker nodes, which can be scaled up or down. To register Hadoop Slave nodes Consul is used.

**Features**

 - creating two types of nodes through contextualisation
 - utilising health check against a predefined port
 - using scaling parameters to limit the number of Hadoop Slave nodes
 - manage cluster nodes with Consul

**Prerequisites**

 - accessing a cloud through an Occopus-compatible interface (e.g EC2, Nova, OCCI, etc.)
 - target cloud contains a base 14.04 Ubuntu OS image with cloud-init support
 - generated ssh key-pair (or for testing purposes one is attached)

**Download**

You can download the example as `tutorial.examples.hadoop-cluster <../../examples/hadoop-cluster.tgz>`_ .

.. note::

   In this tutorial, we will use nova cloud resources (based on our nova tutorials in the basic tutorial section). However, feel free to use any Occopus-compatible cloud resource for the nodes, but we suggest to instantiate all nodes in the same cloud.

**Steps**

#. Open the file ``nodes/node_definitions.yaml`` and edit the resource section of the nodes labelled by ``node_def:``.

   - you must select an `Occopus compatible resource plugin <clouds.html>`_ 
   - you can find and specify the relevant `list of attributes for the plugin <createinfra.html#resource>`_
   - you may follow the help on `collecting the values of the attributes for the plugin <createinfra.html#collecting-resource-attributes>`_
   - you may find a resource template for the plugin in the `resource plugin tutorials <tutorial-resource-plugins.html>`_

   The downloadable package for this example contains a resource template for the Nova plugin.

   .. important::

     Do not modify the values of the contextualisation and the health_check sectionâ€™s attributes!
 
   .. important::

     Do not specify the server_name attribute for slaves so they are named automatically by Occopus to make sure node names are unique!
 
   .. note::

     If you want Occopus to monitor (health_check) your Hadoop Master and it is to be deployed in a different network, make sure you assign public (floating) IP to the Master node.

#. Components in the infrastructure connect to each other, therefore several port ranges must be opened for the VMs executing the components. Clouds implement port opening various way (e.g. security groups for OpenStack, etc). Make sure you implement port opening in your cloud for the following port ranges:

   .. code::

      TCP 22
      TCP 8025
      TCP 8042
      TCP 8088
      TCP 8300-8600
      TCP 9000
      TCP 50000-51000
 
#. Make sure your authentication information is set correctly in your authentication file. You must set your authentication data for the ``resource`` you would like to use. Setting authentication information is described :ref:`here <authentication>`.

#. Update the number of Hadoop Slave worker nodes if necessary. For this, edit the ``infra-occopus-hadoop.yaml`` file and modifiy the min and max parameter under the scaling keyword. Scaling is the interval in which the number of nodes can change (min, max). Currently, the minimum is set to 2 (which will be the initial number at startup), and the maximum is set to 10.

   .. code::

     - &S
    	name: hadoop-slave
    	type: hadoop_slave_node
    	scaling:
        	min: 2
        	max: 10
 
   .. important::

     Important: Keep in mind that Occopus has to start at least one node from each node type to work properly and scaling can be applied only for Hadoop Slave nodes in this example!

#. Load the node definitions into the database. Make sure the proper virtualenv is activated!

   .. important::

      Occopus takes node definitions from its database when builds up the infrastructure, so importing is necessary whenever the node definition or any imported (e.g. contextualisation) file changes!

   .. code::

      occopus-import nodes/node_definitions.yaml

#. Start deploying the infrastructure.

   .. code::

      occopus-build infra-hadoop-cluster.yaml

#. After successful finish, the nodes with ``ip address`` and ``node id`` are listed at the end of the logging messages and the identifier of the newly built infrastructure is printed. You can store the identifier of the infrastructure to perform further operations on your infra or alternatively you can query the identifier using the **occopus-maintain** command.

   .. code::

      List of nodes/ip addresses:
      hadoop-master:
          192.168.xxx.xxx (3116eaf5-89e7-405f-ab94-9550ba1d0a7c)
      hadoop-slave:
          192.168.xxx.xxx (23f13bd1-25e7-30a1-c1b4-39c3da15a456)
          192.168.xxx.xxx (7b387348-b3a3-5556-83c3-26c43d498f39)

      14032858-d628-40a2-b611-71381bd463fa

#. You can check the  health and statistics of the cluster through the following web pages:

   .. code::
      
      Health of nodes: "http://<HadoopMasterIP>:50070"
      Job statistics: "http://<HadoopMasterIP>:8088"

#. To launch a Hadoop MapReduce job copy your input and executable files to the Hadoop Master node, and perform the submission described `here <https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/hadoop-mapreduce-client/hadoop-mapreduce-client-core/MapReduceTutorial.html>`_ . To login to the Hadoop Master node use the private key attached to the tutorial package:

   .. code::

      ssh -i builtin_hadoop_private_key hduser@[HadoopMaster ip]

#. Finally, you may destroy the infrastructure using the infrastructure id returned by ``occopus-build``

   .. code::

      occopus-destroy -i 14032858-d628-40a2-b611-71381bd463fa
