What is Occopus?
****************

Occopus is an easy-to-use hybrid cloud orchestration tool. It is a framework that provides features
for configuring and orchestrating distributed applications (so called virtual infrastructures) on
single or multi cloud systems. Occopus can be used by application developers and devops to create
and deploy complex virtual infrastructures as well as to manage them at deployment time and at runtime.
